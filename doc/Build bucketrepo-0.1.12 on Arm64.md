# create bucketrepo container image

This document describes how to build Bucketrepo-0.1.12 on Arm64.

The main reference is the build instruction in 

https://github.com/jenkins-x/bucketrepo

which is written for and verified on x86-64.

# Environment

The build is run natively on Arm64 machines.   The server used is:   

-Memory : 32 G  

 -CPU: 32 cores  

# prerequisites

- install go  version>=1.13.8

  For arm64, follow this link to download Go 1.13.8 

  https://golang.google.cn/dl/go1.13.8.linux-arm64.tar.gz

  Download the archive and extract it.

- install Pre-commit

  I used pip. Other installation methods exist as well.

  `$ pip install pre-commit`

- install Dep

  https://github.com/golang/dep

- update go proxy and environment

  If your area can not access Google,you should set go proxy

  `$ go env -w GO111MODULE=on`
  `$ go env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io,direct`

- set GOPATH

  `$ export GOPATH=your file`

# Build Bucketrepo

```
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/bucketrepo.git
make build

```

Now,the binary files are built in folder __bin__.you can see it .

```
ls -l bin
total 28036
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 28706255 Sep 22 11:13 bucketrepo
```

Now, bucketrepo binary file has been built.

next , building container images ,then deploying bucketrepo with helm.

# build images 

the buckerrepo dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
COPY ./config/config.yaml /
COPY ./bin/ /
ENTRYPOINT ["/bucketrepo"]
```

Here is an example of what I used,You can refer to the following link:https://github.com/yyunk/jenkins-x-arm-support/tree/master/doc/bucketrepo

# deploy on cluster

the chart is in the charts folde: https://github.com/jenkins-x/bucketrepo/tree/master/charts/bucketrepo

change the values.yaml,modify that yaml file to use the container image you build.

Here is an example of what I used in my arm64 server.You can refer to the following link:https://github.com/yyunk/jenkins-x-arm-support/blob/master/doc/bucketrepo/myvalues.yaml

Then run:

`helm upgrade buckerrepo buckerrepo --install --values myvalues.yaml`

# Success criteria

is when both helm charts can be installed and the `Deployment` resources create pods which startup, start Running and don't fail / restart for 5 minutes. That means that the pods startup and don't fail basically.

You can use command to see it 

`kubectl get pod -w`

```
